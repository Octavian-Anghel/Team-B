Mission Statement: To develop software that helps reduce imposter syndrome and provides easily accessible help and resources to newer computer science students.

Problem Statement 1:
Many individuals who are learning new skills, especially in online and remote learning environments, experience imposter syndrome, which leads to self-doubt and decreased confidence. 
For example, aspiring programmers often doubt their abilities, fearing that they don't belong in the tech industry, and this self-doubt hinders their progress and overall learning experience.
Prior solutions, such as online forums and tutorials, offer some assistance, but they often lack personalized support and guidance. Prior solutions don't address the root cause of imposter syndrome effectively, as they fail to provide the emotional and motivational support learners need to overcome self-doubt and the fear of failure.
How can we design an online learning support system that not only provides technical assistance but also fosters a sense of belonging, builds confidence, and empowers learners to overcome imposter syndrome, 
all while adhering to online learning standards and resources?

Problem Statement 2:
"In the realm of creative arts and design education, many students, especially those engaged in online or remote learning, frequently grapple with a phenomenon known as imposter syndrome. This experience entails an ongoing belief that their artistic expressions lack significance or originality, ultimately impeding their creative development and overall educational journey.
While conventional methods, such as peer critiques and feedback, do exist to support students in their creative endeavors, they often fall short in addressing the underlying emotional and psychological facets of imposter syndrome. Consequently, many students find themselves lacking the necessary tools to effectively combat self-doubt and nurture their creative potential.
Our challenge lies in the development of an online learning support system tailored explicitly for creative arts and design education. This system should not only equip students with technical skills but also cultivate a profound sense of artistic identity, bolster self-confidence, and empower learners to triumph over imposter syndrome. 
Moreover, it must seamlessly integrate with established online creative education standards and resources."
