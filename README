Mission Statement: To develop software that helps reduce imposter syndrome and provides easily accessible help and resources to newer computer science students.

Problem Statement 1:
Many people learning new skills, especially in online and remote learning environments, experience imposter syndrome, leading to self-doubt and decreased confidence. For example, new programmers often doubt their abilities, fearing that they don't belong in the tech industry, and this self-doubt hinders their progress and overall learning experience. Prior solutions, such as online forums and tutorials, offer some assistance but often need more personalized support and guidance. Previous solutions don't address the root cause of imposter syndrome effectively, as they fail to provide the emotional and motivational support learners need to overcome self-doubt and the fear of failure. How can we design an online learning support system that provides technical assistance and, fosters a sense of belonging, builds confidence, and empowers learners to overcome imposter syndrome while adhering to online learning standards and resources?


Problem Statement 2:
Many students pursuing technology-related careers, particularly in online or remote learning settings, struggle with imposter syndrome, a persistent belief that their work is sub-par or should be better for where they are within the field.
While traditional methods like critiques and peer feedback exist, they often fail to address imposter syndrome's underlying emotional and psychological aspects, leaving students without adequate tools to overcome self-doubt and nurture their talents. How can we develop an online learning support system tailored to technology education that provides technical skills and fosters a sense of artistic identity, builds self-confidence, and empowers learners to conquer imposter syndrome while aligning with the standards and resources available in online creative education?"
