Mission Statement: To develop software that helps reduce imposter syndrome and provides easily accessible help and resources to newer computer science students.

Problem Statement 1:
Many individuals who are learning new skills, especially in online and remote learning environments, experience imposter syndrome, which leads to self-doubt and decreased confidence. 
For example, aspiring programmers often doubt their abilities, fearing that they don't belong in the tech industry, and this self-doubt hinders their progress and overall learning experience.
Prior solutions, such as online forums and tutorials, offer some assistance, but they often lack personalized support and guidance. Prior solutions don't address the root cause of imposter syndrome effectively, as they fail to provide the emotional and motivational support learners need to overcome self-doubt and the fear of failure.
How can we design an online learning support system that not only provides technical assistance but also fosters a sense of belonging, builds confidence, and empowers learners to overcome imposter syndrome, 
all while adhering to online learning standards and resources?
